      <p>
        Pieces are single works of art that are exhibited in a Gallery. Each piece has one uploaded Image along with information about the artists, medium, contacts, links and price. Pieces are also ordered. Pieces with lower numbers will appear first in the Gallery views. If two or more Pieces have the same number, the Piece that was added first will appear before the others. If the Image, Artists or Tags you would like to include have already been added, select select them from the menus below. Otherwise, you can add them on the fly by pressing one of the buttons below. Please note: only the Administrator can add new types of currency.
